DeBugger by Team Kurt Vonnegut

DeBugger is a 2D RPG game developed by Team Kurt Vonnegut as part of Telerik Academy’s OOP course. It is a group-based project, which builds on the Microsoft XNA 4.0 Refresh framework to apply core OOP principles and go beyond the console window.

DeBugger tells the story of Gosho – an ambitious final year student, who studies Law at Sofia University, but aspires to become an IT guru. Unfortunately, he is learning software engineering online and, inexperienced as he is, all his Visual Studio solutions are now full of bugs.

Gosho has no idea how to use JustCode and he has approached you to help him track down and eliminate all the bugs in his code. It is now up to you to guide Gosho through the code, as he throws hardware peripherals at unsuspected bugs.
